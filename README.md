# Shiftlight
An opensource shiftlight project using Arduino and Neopixel products

In this repository you will find;
- The .ino file that you can upload directly to your Arduino 
- A .png image of the wiring diagram
- A .jpeg image of how the finished assembly should look
- An .stl file for a housing for the shift light (Suits Daihatsu, but can be modified)
- An .stl file for a housinig for the Arduino
- An .md file containing a detailed parts list.

Currently the easiest DIY shiftlight on the world wide web, your're welcome ;)


Notes:


- This example uses a voltage divider and transistor to pull down the the tacho signal from 12v,

if your car uses a 5v tacho signal this is not needed.


- You will need to download and install the adafruit neopixel library for IDE
